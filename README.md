# Advent of Go 2021

These are my solutions (in Go) to Advent of Code 2021 (https://adventofcode.com/2020), a daily programming challenge.

Most days require an input file:

    go run main.go -d 2 -i day02/input.txt

This year I'm tryin' to do the TDD thing ... I'm keeping a journal in JOURNAL.md.
