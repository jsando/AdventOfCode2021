# Advent of Go 2021

These are my solutions (in Go) to Advent of Code 2021 (https://adventofcode.com/2020), a daily programming challenge.

Most days require an input file:

    go run main.go -d 2 -i day02/input.txt

Please note this is not supposed to be 'production' code!!! If you don't see any unit tests and go 'wow this guy sucks', 
well there aren't supposed to be any unit tests! Now, if you look at the code and say 'wow this guy sucks' then I guess
I deserve that :)
